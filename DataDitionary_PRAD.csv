Data Dictionary - PRAD,Type,Level,Description
alphaG[1],Model parameter,Individual,Decision threshold of go process after a correct choice
alphaG[2],Model parameter,Individual,Decision threshold of go process after a choice error
alphaS,Model parameter,Individual,Fixed decision threshold of stop process
betaG,Model parameter,Individual,Initial left-right bias of the go process
deltaG,Model parameter,Individual,Fixed component of go process drift rate
deltaS,Model parameter,Individual,Fixed drift rate of stop process
gamma0 ,Model parameter,Individual,Attention length; determines shape (inflexion point) of how stopping expectancy varies with the number of trials since  last stop singal encountered
gamma1,Model parameter,Individual,"Attention-based adaptivity: Determines whether attention and hence stopping expectancy increase or decrease, and to what extent, as number of trials since last stop singal encountered increases"
kappa0,Model parameter,Individual,Duration sensitivity of go drift rate; determines the inflexion point of the curve for how go-stimilus duration influences go-drift rate
mu,Model parameter,Individual,"Belief updating persisitence; determines effective decay rate for latent tracking of the experienced SSD (determines how tracked SSD ranges between ""mean experienced"" to ""last experienced"" SSD)"
pp,Model parameter,Individual,Intermediate transformation variable
sMin,Model parameter,Individual,Fixed non-decision time for the stop process (< non-decision time of go process)
theta0,Model parameter,Individual,Proclivity for proactive state; Inverse logit of theta0 gives the the base-rate probability of proactive state
theta1,Model parameter,Individual,"Error modulation of cognitive state (sensitivity to stop-failure trial): Values and sign determine shift in cognitive state towards or away from proactivity, after stop-failures and go-omissions"
xMin,Model parameter,Individual,Fixed component of non-decision time for go process (total non-decision time on any trial includes the proactive delay added to this)
betaS,Model parameter,Trial level,Trial level modulation of stopping expectancy (stopping bias); depends on gamma1 and gamma0
delta,Model parameter,Trial level,Go process drift rate on a particular trial; Depends on deltaG and kappa0
sd,Model parameter,Trial level,"Latent indicator variable for each trial: 1  - proactive state active; 0  = proactive state not active.  Drawn from a Bernoulli distribution with parameters based on theta0, theta1, and past errors"
stProc,Model parameter,Trial level,Latent variable representing the SSRT + SSD time on stop trials
tau,Model parameter,Trial level,"Go process non-decision time on a particular trial, computed as a sum of fixed non-decision time component xMin and  proactive delay tauG on proactive trials (when sd = 1)"
tauG,Model parameter,Trial level,"Latent variable for noisy tracking of SSD, changes from trial to trial based on history of SSD, and decay rate mu"
maxtime,Observed value,Individual,Experimental design: Window of maximum trial time
minT,Observed value,Individual,Shortest uncensored RT observed
dur,Observed value,Trial level,Stimulus presentation duration
goProc,Observed value,Trial level,Choice coded go RT
lcnt,Observed value,Trial level,Number of trials since the last stop trial
Lrerr,Observed value,Trial level,Indicator variable on whether a choice (left vs right) error was made in responding to the go stimulus
ones,Observed value,Trial level,"Array of 1s, used to contribute towards the model likelihood, by mapping the go and stop times and likelihood of trial being a hit or miss vs actual data"
ssdT,Observed value,Trial level,SSD (experimental observation)
stimLR,Observed value,Trial level,Stimulus direction
tr,Observed value,Trial level,Indicator variable for observed trial type (correct go / correct stop / 2 = stop failure / 3 = go-omission)
